# ddg: A DuckDuckGo Instant Answers wrapper library.

This library provides a strongly typed wrapper around the DuckDuckGo Instant
Answers API. Most of the documentation comes from the
[DuckDuckGo Instant Answers API Documentation](https://duckduckgo.com/api)
This library comes with reqwest by default for convenience, however it can be
disabled. If disabled the library will fallback to hyper for `IntoUrl` so it
can be used with your own hyper client implementation.

### [Documentation](https://docs.rs/ddg/)

### Example

```rust
use ddg::Query;
const APP_NAME: &'static str = "ddg_example_app";
// Search for Rust and we want to strip out any HTML content in the answers.
let query = Query::new("Rust", APP_NAME).no_html();

let response = query.execute().unwrap();

println!("{:?}", response);
```
